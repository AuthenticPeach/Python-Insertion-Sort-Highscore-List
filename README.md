# High Score Ranking System

## Functionality
This Python program simulates a high score ranking system. It allows users to input the names and scores of players and maintains a ranking list based on those scores using the Insertion Sort algorithm. The program provides an easy way to track and update player rankings as new scores are added.

## How to Use
1. Run the program by executing the `insertion_sort_ranking.py` file.

2. You will be prompted to enter the number of players you want to add to the ranking list.

3. For each player, enter their name and score when prompted.

4. After entering all player information, the program will update and display the player ranking based on their scores, with the highest scorer at the top.

## Example
Suppose you run the program and enter the following information:
<!--
Enter the number of players: 4

Enter the name of Player 1: Alice
Enter the score of Player 1: 850

Enter the name of Player 2: Bob
Enter the score of Player 2: 720

Enter the name of Player 3: Charlie
Enter the score of Player 3: 950

Enter the name of Player 4: David
Enter the score of Player 4: 620
"""
-->

This demonstrates how the program maintains and updates the player ranking based on user input.
